![Sad room]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/craftroom/before3.jpg)

When I first came home from school, I was back in the same bedroom I’d been in since I was eight. The bunkbed, with sticker gunk still on the ladder. The dresser, with one loose knob and a door that didn’t quite shut. The sky blue walls that were meant to be a base coat for a mural of clouds, but were still just sky blue walls. It was just as I remembered, full of the ghosts of who I had been and what I had done inside this room.

After a few months of dragging my feet, of clinging to the idea that I was making a quick pit stop and would be back to school in the spring… or the fall… or even the next spring, I began to accept my situation. With acceptance, came change, and now I sit typing in a room that pushes me forward, instead of dragging me into the past.

The bunk bed is gone. The dresser is gone. The sky blue walls and the clouds that never made it out of my mind. Gone.

Actually, the whole bedroom is gone. Moved. I gutted my childhood bedroom and grew within its corpse, my studio space.

Off with the blinds. Off with the closet doors. I painted the walls. I found homes for all of my little treasures and in the process I found a home for myself.

No longer am I the girl, curled up on the bottom bunk, afraid to ask for space. I am becoming the person I’ve always longed to be. I am the girl, sprawled out on the carpet, surrounded by piles of fabric and paper, unapologetic about her mess.

I am the girl who keeps a closet full of things other people wanted to throw away, ready to discover the beauty in taking something broken or unwanted and giving it new life. 

![closet]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/craftroom/closet.jpg)

Most importantly, I am the girl who is learning to fill this room and my life with the things that bring me joy. It is the best lesson I’ve learned, and I am blessed to have this safe space to explore it in.
