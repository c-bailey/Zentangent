<p>A little over a month ago, inspiration struck. I was “cleaning” my room when I grabbed two thrift store finds and upon seeing them side by side an idea was born. I haven’t made a stuffed animal in 2-3 years and my skills then were amateur at best, but in one moment I became convinced that I could create a plushie monster that is equal parts derpy-as-fuck and adorable. It would be loveable, endearing, and non-conformist. It would be the Zooey Deschanel New Girl of stuffed animals.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The problem is, I wanted it to be both brilliant and fast. I wanted it to be easy and also perfect. It only took until after I had seam-ripped the garments for me to realize I was in over my head. By the time I had a few limbs stitched and stuffed I already didn’t want to look at this project ever again.</p>

<p>It would be the understatement of the year to say that I have project commitment issues. In my room there is a whole drawer dedicated to incomplete work that I can’t bring myself to either finish or give away. If it was up to me, Munster would be a set of arms and legs in that drawer, but it wasn’t up to me.</p>

<p>One aspect of my diagnosed mental illness, is to put it plainly, extreme and constant instability. So, when my case manager heard about my newly adopted and abandoned project, heard how quickly my joy turned to frustration turned to absolute disdain, she gave me a homework assignment. She gave it to me week after week, as I ignored her request. Finish the damn stuffed animal.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to so badly that I argued and fought against it. I refused, declaring it a brave act of protest, when in fact it was my status quo, to abandon any project that I feared might reveal my imperfections.</p>

<p>The Munster that sits in my room today is completed, but was not done so in a joyful manner. For about 20 minutes a week, usually right before an appointment I would rush to finish him then and there. I would sew at high speeds in a rage and slap hot glue over his face until I had burned every fingertip. Inevitably I would spend 20 minutes raging against this stupid stuffed animal and not have a finished product to show for it. Until one day, he was just done. I sat on the floor of my room, trying to escape the hot glue spider web I had created around myself, stepping on pins in the process and looked down to realize he was done. He wasn’t polished or pretty, but he had four limbs, a face, and was stuffed and sealed as best as I was willing to put in the effort to do, and it felt really <em>really</em> good.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ugly/uglydetails.jpg" alt="Munster's Details" /></p>

<p>It felt so good in fact, that after 5 months, I am finally writing my second blog post. The reality is that my insatiable desire for perfection holds me back in almost everything I do. There are over a dozen half-written articles that inevitably didn’t make the cut, and like Munster’s original fate are doomed to sit in my hard-drive, pushed out of sight and out of mind in hopes that they will never see the light of day. This craving for perfection seeps into my art in the most devious of ways. Even in the privacy of my own room, even knowing that no one ever has to see what I am making, I still become paralyzed by the fear of imperfection. My own private journals read like soap operas, because of that constant fear that what I do, what I create might not be interesting, good, or have any value. I am always performing for an audience, even when I can’t see one. Finishing Munster wasn’t about improving my skills. It wasn’t about making something that I was proud of. It wasn’t even about patience or joy or taking deep calming breaths. It was just a big middle finger to the critic in my head to say “Yeah, I make shitty stuff. Look, I made this terrible piece of shit and the world didn’t end.” It was about the catharsis of hating something and doing it anyway. It was about stripping my skin and exiting my comfort zone so I could get back to what I always wanted to do and just make. You should try it.</p>

<p>Make something ugly. Make it in a fit of rage or frustration. Sew too fast. Rip fabric or paper. Draw even if you can’t see a damn thing, because you’re sobbing like the hot mess you are. The ugly thing and the ugly process can be such a relief.</p>

<p>Munster is sitting on a shelf behind me as I type. His looming presence is now equal parts creepy and comforting. As a finishing touch, I cut back open his mouth and gave him zipper teeth. He has become the physical manifestation of all of my worst fears and self-doubt. When my thoughts become too much I’ve begun to write them on scraps, crumple them up and feed them to Munster. In fact I have just fed him a hearty writers-fear lunch. I fed him the fear that my words aren’t worth reading. I fed him the fear that I am both too boring and over-dramatic – that every metaphor I use is a cliché or that my best work I stole from the tongues of dead authors who I will never be as good as.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ugly/uglyfed.jpg" alt="Feeding Munster" /></p>

<p>On a really bad day I’ll feed him the fear that all of my friends have forgotten me. Or the fear that everyone eventually leaves. I am told that after years of therapy, the evil voice in my head will at least quiet to a faint hum. Until I learn how to tame my demons or send them off for good, I can at least feed them to Munster. I can write them down, get them out, and seal them away.</p>

<p>So as it turns out I love my ugly, terrible Munster. I hope you take the time to make something ugly yourself and then feel how beautiful that can be.</p>
