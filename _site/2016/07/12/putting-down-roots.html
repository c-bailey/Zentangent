<p>When I first came home from school, I was back in the same bedroom I’d been in since I was eight. The bunkbed, with sticker gunk still on the ladder. The dresser, with one loose knob and a door that didn’t quite shut. The sky blue walls that were meant to be a base coat for a mural of clouds, but were still just sky blue walls. It was just as I remembered, full of the ghosts of who I had been and what I had done inside this room.</p>

<p>After a few months of dragging my feet, of clinging to the idea that I was making a quick pit stop and would be back to school in the spring… or the fall… or even the next spring, I began to accept my situation. With acceptance, came change, and now I sit typing in a room that pushes me forward, instead of dragging me into the past.</p>

<p><img src="/images/craftroom/full1.jpg" alt="Full" /></p>

<p>The bunk bed is gone. The dresser is gone. The sky blue walls and the clouds that never made it out of my mind. Gone.</p>

<p><img src="/images/craftroom/craft4.jpg" alt="craft table" /></p>

<p>Actually, the whole bedroom is gone. Moved. I gutted my childhood bedroom and grew within its corpse, my studio space.</p>

<p><img src="/images/craftroom/fabric7.jpg" alt="fabric table" /></p>

<p>Off with the blinds. Off with the closet doors. I painted the walls. I found homes for all of my little treasures and in the process I found a home for myself.</p>

<p><img src="/images/craftroom/mirror2.jpg" alt="mirror" /></p>

<p>No longer am I the girl, curled up on the bottom bunk, afraid to ask for space. I am becoming the person I’ve always longed to be. I am the girl, sprawled out on the carpet, surrounded by piles of fabric and paper, unapologetic about her mess.</p>

<p><img src="/images/craftroom/rug.jpg" alt="rug" /></p>

<p>I am the girl who keeps a closet full of things other people wanted to throw away, ready to discover the beauty in taking something broken or unwanted and giving it new life.</p>

<p><img src="/images/craftroom/closet.jpg" alt="closet" /></p>

<p>Most importantly, I am the girl who is learning to fill this room and my life with the things that bring me joy. It is the best lesson I’ve learned, and I am blessed to have this safe space to explore it in.</p>
